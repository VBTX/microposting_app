# Ruby on Rails microposting sample app

## Getting started

Clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install

```

Then, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate

```

Then, run the test suite to verify that everything is working properly:

```
$ rails test

```

If the test suite passes, run the app in the local server:

```
$ rails server

```
